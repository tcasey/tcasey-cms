headline: Assessing students improves learning.
description: While attending a development boot camp I sought out to build a better testing platform to improve the level of graduates. It was a system which instructors would use to add tutorial like content divided up into units. Each unit had an assessment test that was used to unlock the next section. The most difficult part was the tests & evaluating the students code. We decided to use a web worker to encapsulate the code and evaluate it to see if it returned to expected value. There was also a part which would allow you to compare your assessment results with that of the others in your cohort.
