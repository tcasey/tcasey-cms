description: My last portfolio site. I originally optimized it for mobile devices but through analytics came to find out my visitors were mostly on desktop so I pivoted a couple times to optimize the experience for those users. My favorite parts that I worked on were probably the D3 chart that reflected my skills at the time and the hexagon grid that was done completely with CSS.
