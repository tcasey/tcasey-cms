  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

      It was an incredible experience working with Trevor. He just "got it". Rarely would I have to do much explanation or justification of different UX/UI requirements. He quickly understood the concepts and the bigger picture reasons. He even would offer insightful suggestions that others might not have thought of. He was wicked fast to get up to speed on our systems and code base, finding fixes and solutions that had been baffling other seasoned developers within his first week. Any team would be lucky to have Trevor in their midst.

      Trevor is a very gifted developer. He was a great co-worker, friend, and mentor in the time we spent together at Convirza. Since my first day on the job, he helped me get up to speed rapidly and I could always rely on him to bounce ideas off of. When working together nothing stood in our way and we were very efficient as a team. I'd highly recommend Trevor for any team as he is a strong asset and has a good personality fit.

      I was so excited to work with Trevor at DevMountain after seeing some of his previous projects. He is incredibly skilled at all aspects of the MEAN Stack. Not only is his functionality extremely clean and consistent, but his eye for design and creativity is incredible. With his leadership ,we were able to create an incredible app that I feel will be very valuable to DevMountain and their ability to produce top notch students.
